    "\n",
    "Euclidean distance is more sensitive to differences in all dimensions because it involves squaring the differences.\n",

    "Impact on Decision Boundaries:\n",
    "\n",
    "KNN decision boundaries are influenced by the distance metric. In regions where the decision boundaries are curved or diagonal, Euclidean distance may perform better, capturing the geometric relationships more accurately.\n",
    "In regions where the decision boundaries are aligned with the coordinate axes, Manhattan distance may perform better.\n",
    "Scale Sensitivity:\n",
    "\n",
    "Euclidean distance is sensitive to the scale of the features, as it squares the differences.\n",
    "Manhattan distance is less sensitive to the scale, as it only considers absolute differences.\n",
    "Computational Efficiency:\n",
    "\n",
    "Manhattan distance can be computationally more efficient to calculate than Euclidean distance, as it doesn't involve square roots.\n",

    "Hybrid Approaches:\n",
